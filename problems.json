The width of the container is `right - left`, and the height is limited by the shorter of the two lines (`min(height[left], height[right])`). We calculate this area and keep track of the maximum area found.\n\nThe core insight is how to move the pointers. To potentially find a larger area, we must increase either the width or the height. Since we start at maximum width, the only way to increase the area is by finding a greater height. If we move the pointer of the taller line inwards, the new height will be at best the same as the shorter line, but the width will have decreased, guaranteeing the area cannot be larger. Therefore, we must move the pointer of the shorter line inwards, as this is the only move that holds the potential to find a taller line and thus a larger area. This greedy choice guarantees we never miss the optimal solution. A brute-force approach of checking every pair of lines would be O(N^2), making this two-pointer solution far more efficient.",

We calculate the sum `nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r]`. \n- If the sum is less than zero, we need a larger value, so we increment `l`.\n- If the sum is greater than zero, we need a smaller value, so we decrement `r`.\n- If the sum is zero, we've found a triplet. We add it to our results and move both pointers to search for new pairs.\n\nA crucial step is to handle duplicates. After finding a valid triplet, we must advance our pointers past any subsequent identical elements to ensure each unique triplet is found only once. We also skip duplicates for the initial `i` pointer.",

We then loop through these letters.

A naive approach might be to traverse the list once to find its length (L), then traverse it again `L-n` times to find the node to remove.

This is a crucial trick that simplifies handling edge cases, like removing the actual head of the list.\n\nWe initialize two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both starting at the `dummy` node. We first advance the `fast` pointer `n+1` steps ahead. The `+1` is so that the `slow` pointer will end up on the node *before* the one we want to delete.\n\nAfter this initial gap is created, we move both `fast` and `slow` pointers one step at a time until `fast` reaches the end of the list (i.e., `fast` is `None`).

A combination is valid if two conditions are always met:\n1. The number of open parentheses `(` never exceeds `n`.\n2. The number of closing parentheses `)` never exceeds the number of open parentheses.\n\nWe can implement this with a recursive function, say `backtrack(current_string, open_count, close_count)`. The base case is when the `current_string` length is `2 * n`. At this point, we've formed a complete, valid combination, so we add it to our results.\n\nIn the recursive step, we have two choices:\n1. Add an open parenthesis: If `open_count < n`, we can add a `(`. We then make a recursive call with the updated string and `open_count + 1`.\n2. Add a closing parenthesis: If `close_count < open_count`, we can add a `)`.

The crucial modifications are:\n1.  **Sort the Candidates**: First, sort the `candidates` array. This is essential for easily handling duplicates.\n2.  **Modify Recursion**: In the recursive call `backtrack(..., i)`, we now pass `i + 1` as the next start index: `backtrack(..., i + 1)`. This enforces the rule that each number can be used at most once.\n3.  **Handle Duplicates**: Because the array is sorted, all duplicate numbers are adjacent. To avoid generating duplicate combinations (e.g., using the first '1' and a '7' vs. using the second '1' and a '7'), we add a check inside our loop. If the current element `candidates[i]` is the same as the previous one `candidates[i-1]`, and we are not at the beginning of the loop for this level of recursion (`i > start_index`), we skip it.

Sorting brings all duplicate numbers next to each other, making them easy to identify and skip.\n2.  Use the same recursive backtracking function as before.\n3.  **Add the duplicate-skipping logic**: Inside the `for` loop of our recursive step, we add a condition: `if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1] and not used[i-1]: continue`. Let's break this down:\n    -   `i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]`: This identifies a duplicate number.\n    -   `not used[i-1]`: This is the crucial part. It means that the *previous* identical number (`nums[i-1]`) has already been considered and then *backtracked* from at this level of recursion.

To reach `(i, j)`, we must have come from either `(i-1, j)` or `(i, j-1)`. To ensure the path to `(i, j)` is minimal, we must have taken the minimal path to get to the preceding cell.

The distance is the same as the distance for the prefixes without this character: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.\n    -   **If the characters are different:** We must perform one operation.

The goal is to find the smallest substring in `s` that contains all characters of `t` (including duplicates).\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    -   Create a frequency map (`t_counts`) for the characters in `t`.\n    -   Initialize a `window_counts` map for the characters in our current window.\n    -   Use two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), both starting at 0.\n    -   Use variables to track progress: `have` (how many unique characters from `t` we've satisfied) and `need` (total unique characters in `t`).\n    -   Use `res` to store the bounds of the minimum window found so far.\n\n2.  **Expand the Window:** Move the `r` pointer to the right, one character at a time. For each character `c = s[r]`:\n    -   Increment its count in `window_counts`.\n    -   If `c` is a character we need (i.e., in `t_counts`) and its count in the window now matches its required count (`window_counts[c] == t_counts[c]`), increment `have`.\n\n3.  **Shrink the Window:** Once `have == need`, we have a valid window. Now, we try to shrink it from the left to find the smallest possible valid window.\n    -   While `have == need`, update our `res` if the current window `(r - l + 1)` is smaller.\n    -   Move the `l` pointer to the right. For the character `s[l]`:\n        -   Decrement its count in `window_counts`.\n        -   If this character is one we need and its count just dropped below the required count, decrement `have`.

We use the **slow and fast pointer** technique. We also need a `prev` pointer to track the node *before* the slow pointer so we can sever the list for the recursive call.\n3.  **Partition and Recurse:**\n    -   Once the middle node (`slow`) is found, it becomes the `root`.\n    -   The node before it, `prev`, now marks the end of the left half of the list.

A naive solution might be to calculate the height of the left and right subtrees for every node, but this would be inefficient as we would re-calculate heights repeatedly.\n\nThe optimal solution is a **bottom-up recursive DFS**. We can write a helper function that does two things: it calculates the height of a subtree, and it also checks if that subtree is balanced.\n\n1.  Define a recursive helper `check_height(node)`.\n2.  **Base Case:** If `node` is `None`, it's balanced and has a height of 0. Return `0`.\n3.  **Recursive Step:**\n    -   Recursively call on the left child: `left_height = check_height(node.left)`.\n    -   Recursively call on the right child: `right_height = check_height(node.right)`.\n4.  **Check for Imbalance:** During the recursive calls, if a subtree is found to be unbalanced, we need a way to propagate this failure signal up. A common trick is to have the helper function return a special value, like `-1`, to indicate imbalance.\n    -   If `left_height` is `-1` or `right_height` is `-1`, it means a child subtree was unbalanced, so the current tree is also unbalanced. Return `-1`.\n    -   Also, check the current node: if `abs(left_height - right_height) > 1`, the current node is unbalanced. Return `-1`.\n5.  **Return Height:** If the node and its subtrees are balanced, return its height: `1 + max(left_height, right_height)`.\n6.

We can optimize this by pre-computing all possible palindrome substrings.\n\n**Optimized DP Approach:**\n1.  **Pre-computation:** Create a 2D DP table `is_palindrome[i][j]` which is true if `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome. This can be filled in O(N^2).\n2.  **Main DP:**\n    -   Initialize a `cuts` array of size `n`. `cuts[i]` will be the min cuts for `s[:i+1]`.\n    -   Loop `i` from `0` to `n-1`.\n    -   For each `i`, the worst-case number of cuts is `i` (cutting each character).\n    -   Loop `j` from `0` to `i`. If `s[j:i+1]` is a palindrome (checked using our pre-computed table), then we can potentially make a cut before `j`. The number of cuts would be `cuts[j-1] + 1`.

The core is the **pigeonhole principle**.\n1.  **Find Min/Max and Gap:** Find the minimum (`min_v`) and maximum (`max_v`) values in the array. If all numbers are the same, the gap is 0. Otherwise, the minimum possible value for the maximum gap is `ceil((max_v - min_v) / (n - 1))`. Let's call this `bucket_size`.\n2.  **Create Buckets:** Create `(n-1)` buckets. Each bucket will store the minimum and maximum of the numbers that fall into its range.\n3.  **Distribute Numbers:** Iterate through the numbers. For each `num`, place it in the appropriate bucket. The index of the bucket for `num` can be calculated as `(num - min_v) // bucket_size`. For each number, we only update the min and max values within its bucket.\n4.  **Scan Buckets:** The maximum gap will not be within a single bucket. It must exist *between* the maximum of one bucket and the minimum of the next non-empty bucket. Iterate through the buckets, keeping track of the `previous` bucket's max value. Calculate the gap `current_bucket.min - previous_bucket.max` and update the overall maximum gap.",

Each building creates two events:\n    -   A 'start' event at its left edge `L`, with its height `H`. To distinguish starts from ends, we can store the height as negative: `(L, -H, R)`.\n    -   An 'end' event at its right edge `R`. We can represent this as `(R, 0, 0)` or similar.\n2.  **Sort Events:** Sort the list of all events primarily by their x-coordinate. If x-coordinates are equal, a start event (`-H`) should come before an end event (`0`).\n3.  **Process Events (Sweep-Line):**\n    -   Initialize a `result` list and a `max_heap` to store the heights of the currently 'active' buildings. The heap should store `(height, right_edge)` and should initially contain `(0, infinity)` as a ground level.\n    -   Iterate through the sorted events `(x, h, R)`:\n        -   **Remove Old Buildings:** First, pop from the heap any buildings whose right edge has already been passed by our sweep line (`x >= heap[0].R`).\n        -   **Add New Building:** If the current event is a start event (`h` is negative), push its height and right edge onto the max-heap: `push(-h, R)`.\n        -   **Check for New Key Point:** After updating the heap, the current maximum height is the top of the heap.

The maximum profit from robbing houses `1` to `n-1` (i.e., we rob the last house but *not* the first house).\n\nBy taking the maximum of these two scenarios, we cover all possibilities while respecting the circular constraint.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n1.  Handle the edge case of a list with only one house.\n2.  Create a helper function that implements the O(1) space DP solution for the original House Robber I problem.\n3.

This is equivalent to finding the **longest palindromic prefix** of the original string `s`. If the longest palindromic prefix is `s[0:i]`, then the characters we need to add to the front are the reverse of the remaining suffix `s[i:]`.\n\nExample: `s = \"aacecaaa\"`. The longest palindromic prefix is `\"aacecaa\"`. The remaining suffix is `\"a\"`. We need to prepend the reverse of `\"a\"`, which is just `\"a\"`. Result: `\"aaacecaaa\"`.\n\nThe challenge is finding this longest palindromic prefix efficiently. This can be done with advanced string algorithms like **KMP**.\n\n**KMP-based Approach:**\n1.  Create a temporary string: `temp = s + '#' + s.reverse()`.\n2.  Compute the KMP preprocessing array (often called LPS - Longest Proper Prefix which is also a Suffix) for this `temp` string.\n3.  The last value in the LPS array, `lps[-1]`, gives the length of the longest prefix of `temp` that is also a suffix. By our construction of `temp`, this is exactly the length of the longest palindromic prefix of the original `s`.\n4.  Let this length be `l`. The part of `s` that is not part of this palindrome is `s[l:]`. \n5.  The characters to add to the front are the reverse of this suffix: `s[l:].reverse()`.\n6.  Return `s[l:].reverse() + s`.",

This is crucial for the two-pointer approach.\n2.  **Outer Loop:** Iterate through the array with a pointer `i` from `0` to `n-3`.\n3.  **Two-Pointer Scan:** For each `nums[i]`, we need to find pairs `(nums[l], nums[r])` in the rest of the array such that `nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r] < target`.

Set `dp[0] = 1`.\n    -   Initialize three pointers, `p2`, `p3`, `p5`, all to 0.

A naive solution would be to create a copy of the board, calculate the next state for each cell based on the original, and store it in the copy. This would use O(M*N) space. The challenge is to do it with **O(1) space**.\n\nTo do this in-place, we need to store both the original state and the next state in each cell simultaneously. We can use extra integer states:\n-   `0`: dead -> dead\n-   `1`: live -> live\n-   `2`: live -> dead (was 1, will be 0)\n-   `3`: dead -> live (was 0, will be 1)\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  **First Pass (Marking):** Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` of the board.\n    -   For each cell, count its number of live neighbors. When counting, we only care about the *original* state. A cell is originally live if its value is `1` or `2`.\n    -   Apply the game rules based on the original state and the neighbor count to determine the next state. Mark the cell with one of the four states above. For example, if a live cell (1) has 1 neighbor, it will die. We mark it as state `2`.\n2.  **Second Pass (Finalizing):** Iterate through the board again.\n    -   Update each cell to its final state:\n        -   `0` and `2` become `0`.\n        -   `1` and `3` become `1`.\nThis two-pass approach allows us to calculate all next states based on the original board state before overwriting them.",

This means smaller numbers should be in even positions and larger numbers in odd positions.\n\nThe core idea is to separate the numbers into two halves: a 'smaller half' and a 'larger half'. The median of the array is the natural dividing point. All numbers in the larger half should be placed in the 'peak' positions (odd indices), and all numbers in the smaller half should be placed in the 'valley' positions (even indices).\n\nThe provided solution uses a straightforward sorting-based approach. It sorts the numbers (implicitly, by using a heap) and then places them.\n1.  **Sort**: A max-heap is used to get the numbers in descending order. This is equivalent to sorting the array in O(N log N) time.\n2.  **Place**: The largest numbers are popped from the heap first. These are placed into the odd indices `1, 3, 5, ...`. After the odd indices are filled, the remaining (smaller) numbers are placed into the even indices `0, 2, 4, ...`.\n\nThis guarantees the wiggle property. The largest half of the numbers will occupy the peaks, and the smallest half will occupy the valleys, ensuring `small < big > small`.\n\nA more optimal O(N) time, O(1) space solution exists using the median-of-medians algorithm (or Quickselect to find the median) and a virtual indexing mapping, but it is significantly more complex to implement.",

We are looking for a subarray sum that equals `k`. So, we want to find indices `i` and `j` such that `prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] = k`.\n\nRearranging this equation gives `prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[j] - k`.\n\nSo, as we iterate through the array and calculate the current prefix sum, let's call it `current_sum` (which is `prefix_sum[j]`), we can ask: 'Have we seen a previous prefix sum equal to `current_sum - k`?'\n\nWe can use a hash map to answer this question in O(1) time. The map will store `{prefix_sum: first_index_of_occurrence}`. As we iterate with index `j`, we calculate `current_sum`. We look for `current_sum - k` in our map. If it exists at an index `i`, then the subarray from `i+1` to `j` sums to `k`, and its length is `j - i`.

The stack-based approach is very intuitive. We iterate through the nodes. When we see a number, we push it onto the stack. When we see a '#', we also push it. Then, we check if the top two elements of the stack are both '#'. If they are, it means we've found a node (the one below the two '#') whose children have both been fully explored. We can effectively 'collapse' this `(number, #, #)` subtree into a single '#' on the stack, representing a now-fully-explored null slot from the perspective of its parent.

Validating a BST at each node takes O(k) where k is the size of the subtree, leading to an overall `O(N^2)` solution. A more efficient approach is a single post-order DFS traversal (bottom-up). For each node, our recursive function needs to return several pieces of information from its children: 1) Is the child's subtree a valid BST? 2) What is its size? 3) What are the minimum and maximum values within it? With this info, a parent node can determine if its own subtree is a valid BST by checking if `left_max < parent.val < right_min` and if both children are valid BSTs.

The optimal solution uses Dynamic Programming on the tree with a single DFS traversal. For each node, we need to determine the maximum amount of money we can rob from its subtree under two scenarios: 1) We **rob** the current node. 2) We **do not rob** the current node. We can create a recursive function `dfs(node)` that returns a pair of values `(rob_this_node, dont_rob_this_node)`. \n- `rob_this_node = node.val + dont_rob_left_child + dont_rob_right_child`\n- `dont_rob_this_node = max(rob_left, dont_rob_left) + max(rob_right, dont_rob_right)`\nWe use a post-order traversal (bottom-up), so when we compute the result for a node, the results for its children are already available.

A simple `O(N log N)` solution is to loop from 0 to `num` and count the bits for each number. However, we can do better with Dynamic Programming and bit manipulation. Notice the pattern: the bit counts for `0-1` are `[0, 1]`. For `2-3` (`10`, `11`), they are `[1, 2]`, which is `1 + [count for 0, count for 1]`. For `4-7` (`100` to `111`), they are `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, which is `1 + [counts for 0, 1, 2, 3]`. This reveals a relationship: `countBits(x) = countBits(x - offset) + 1`, where `offset` is the most significant power of 2 less than or equal to `x`. A simpler DP relation is `countBits(x) = countBits(x >> 1) + (x & 1)`.

We use two pointers, a `left` and a `right`, to define the boundaries of our current substring (the window). We also use a hash map to keep track of the counts of each character within the window. We expand the window by moving the `right` pointer one step at a time, adding the new character to our map. After each expansion, we check if the number of distinct characters in our map (i.e., `len(map)`) has exceeded K. If it has, we must shrink the window from the left. We do this by moving the `left` pointer forward, decrementing the count of the character at the old `left` position in our map. If a character's count becomes zero, we remove it from the map entirely. We continue shrinking until the distinct character count is back to K.

We can check this condition with a bitmask. The number `0x55555555` in hex is `01010101...` in binary.

However, we can do better by further breaking down `i-j`. So, the product would be `j * dp[i-j]`. We take the maximum over all possible `j`'s. The recurrence is `dp[i] = max(j * (i-j), j * dp[i-j])` for `j` in `1..i-1`. A mathematical insight simplifies this: breaking the number into as many 3s as possible is optimal.

By sorting widths ascending, we ensure we only consider nesting smaller-width envelopes inside larger-width ones. By sorting heights descending for same-width envelopes, we prevent two envelopes with the same width from both being included in our LIS of heights (since `h1 > h2` can't be part of an increasing sequence).

This cleanup step makes `getHits` have an amortized `O(1)` complexity, but worst case `O(N)`. \nA more scalable, space-optimized solution avoids storing every single hit. We can use two arrays of size 300: one for timestamps (`times`) and one for counts (`hits`). `hits[i]` stores the number of hits that occurred at the time stored in `times[i]`.

This suggests a post-order traversal (DFS) where the value returned by a node's recursive call represents its depth from the leaves. We can define a `dfs(node)` function that calculates this depth. The base case is a null node, which can return -1. For any non-null node, its depth is `1 + max(dfs(node.left), dfs(node.right))`. This gives every node a depth value (0 for leaves, 1 for parents of leaves, etc.). As we compute the depth `d` for a node, we can append its value to a results list at index `d`.

A recursive approach, like the manual solution, is also very elegant. We can define a `dfs(node)` function that returns a boolean indicating if there's a carry. The function recurses to the end of the list. The base case is the last node. It adds one. If the new value is 10, it sets its value to 0 and returns `True` (carry). Otherwise, it sets its value and returns `False`. A parent node receives the carry from its child, adds it to its own value, and propagates the carry if needed. The main function needs to handle the case where the head itself has a carry (e.g., `9 -> 9` becomes `1 -> 0 -> 0`), which requires creating a new head node.

The key insight is that an update on a range `[start, end]` only directly affects two points: the `start` index and the index *just after* the end, `end + 1`. We can create a result array `res` initialized to zeros. For each update `[start, end, inc]`: 1. Add `inc` to `res[start]`. This marks the beginning of the increase. 2. Subtract `inc` from `res[end + 1]` (if it's within bounds). This marks the end of the increase; it cancels out the `inc` for all subsequent elements. After processing all updates, the `res` array stores the changes at each point.

For each bit position, if the bits are different (0 and 1), the sum is 1. If they are the same (0 and 0, or 1 and 1), the sum is 0. 2. **Carry**: A carry is generated only when both bits are 1.

We can repeat this process: calculate the sum-without-carry and the new carry. Then, in the next step, we add the new carry to the sum-without-carry. The loop continues until the carry becomes zero.

This problem can be seen as finding the `k` smallest elements from `N` sorted lists, where the i-th list is `[nums1[i]+nums2[0], nums1[i]+nums2[1], ...]`. This is a classic **k-way merge** problem, perfectly suited for a **min-heap**. The algorithm: 1. Create a min-heap. 2. To start, push the first pair from each possible `nums1` element onto the heap. That is, for each `i` in `0..len(nums1)-1`, push `(nums1[i] + nums2[0], i, 0)` onto the heap. The tuple stores the sum, the index from `nums1`, and the index from `nums2`. 3. Loop `k` times: a. Pop the pair with the smallest sum from the heap. Let this be `(sum, i, j)`. Add `[nums1[i], nums2[j]]` to the result. b. This pair used `nums2[j]`. To explore the next smallest sum involving `nums1[i]`, we need to pair it with `nums2[j+1]`.

A naive solution is to flatten the matrix into a single array, sort it, and pick the k-th element. This is `O(N^2 log(N^2))`. We can do much better. The optimal solution uses **binary search on the answer's value range**. The smallest possible answer is `matrix[0][0]` and the largest is `matrix[n-1][n-1]`. We can binary search within this range. For a given `mid` value, we need to efficiently count how many elements in the matrix are `<= mid`. Since rows and columns are sorted, we can do this in `O(N)` time. We start at the bottom-left corner `(row=n-1, col=0)`. If `matrix[row][col] <= mid`, we know all `row+1` elements in that column are also `<= mid`, so we add `row+1` to our count and move right (`col++`). If `matrix[row][col] > mid`, we move up (`row--`). After counting, if the `count < k`, we know the k-th element must be larger, so we search in `[mid+1, high]`.

We can do much better by finding a mathematical relationship between `F(k)` and `F(k-1)`. Let `S` be the sum of all elements in the array `A`. When we rotate the array once, each element `A[i]` moves to index `(i+1)%N`. The element at the very end, `A[N-1]`, moves to the front.

The contribution of `A[N-1]` changes from `(N-1)*A[N-1]` to `0*A[N-1]`, a decrease of `(N-1)*A[N-1]`. The total change is `F(k) = F(k-1) + (S - A[N-1]) - (N-1)*A[N-1] = F(k-1) + S - N*A[N-1]`.

Create a mapping from numbers 0-15 to their hex characters '0'-'9', 'a'-'f'. 2. We can loop 8 times (for a 32-bit integer). In each iteration: a. Use a bitwise AND with a mask of `15` (binary `1111`) to isolate the last 4 bits of the number: `nybble = num & 15`. b. Look up the corresponding hex character for `nybble`. c. Prepend this character to our result string. d. Right-shift the number by 4 bits (`num = num >> 4`) to process the next nybble in the next iteration. 3. After the loop, we handle any leading zeros and return the result.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

Count the frequency of every character in the string using a hash map (`Counter`). 2. Initialize a `length` variable to 0. 3. Iterate through the character counts in the map. For each character, we can use `count // 2 * 2` of them in our palindrome (i.e., all the complete pairs). Add this to our `length`. 4.

The largest possible largest sum is the sum of the entire array if we put it all in one subarray (`high = sum(nums)`). Now we can binary search in this range `[low, high]`. For a given `mid` value (our potential answer), we need a greedy helper function `can_split(max_sum_allowed)` that checks: 'Is it possible to split the array into `m` or fewer subarrays such that no subarray's sum exceeds `max_sum_allowed`?'. This check can be done in `O(N)` by greedily forming subarrays. We iterate through `nums`, adding to a `current_sum`. Once `current_sum` exceeds `max_sum_allowed`, we start a new subarray. We count how many subarrays we need. If `count <= m`, it's a valid split.

We want it to be 1 if possible. A `1` at the 30th bit can be formed if there exist two numbers `a` and `b` in our array such that `a XOR b` has a `1` at this bit. This means the 30th bits of `a` and `b` must be different. We can extend this greedily. We build our `max_xor` result from left to right (MSB to LSB). In each step `i`, we assume the `i`-th bit can be 1. Let our current `potential_max` be `max_xor | (1 << i)`. For this to be possible, there must exist two numbers `a, b` in `nums` such that `a XOR b = potential_max`. This is equivalent to checking if `a XOR potential_max = b`. We can check this efficiently: for a given bit `i`, create a set of all prefixes of length `31-i` for every number in `nums`. Then, for each prefix `p` in the set, check if `potential_max_prefix XOR p` also exists in the set. If we find such a pair, we can achieve a 1 at this bit, so we update `max_xor`. If not, we must settle for a 0. This can also be solved elegantly using a **Trie**.",

A Trie is perfect for this. We insert all words from the input list into the Trie. 2. **Backtracking**: We can define a recursive function `backtrack(current_square)`. `current_square` is a list of words we've chosen so far. a. The base case: if `len(current_square)` equals the length of the words, we have found a valid square, so we add it to our results. b. The recursive step: Let's say we have `i` words in our `current_square`. To find the `(i+1)`-th word, we need a word that starts with a specific prefix. This prefix is formed by taking the `i`-th character from each of the `i` words already in our square. We query our Trie for all words with this prefix.

We can do a single traversal (DFS) from the root. As we traverse, we maintain the `current_path_sum` from the root to the current node. For a path from an ancestor `A` to the current node `C` to sum to `target`, we need `current_path_sum(C) - current_path_sum(A) = target`. Rearranging this, we get `current_path_sum(A) = current_path_sum(C) - target`. This means at node `C`, we need to know how many ancestors on the current path have a prefix sum of `current_path_sum(C) - target`. We can track this efficiently with a **hash map** that stores `prefix_sum -> frequency`. As we traverse down, we add our `current_path_sum` to the map.

The key is to think of the numbers as a **10-ary prefix tree (trie)**. The problem is then to find the k-th node in a pre-order traversal of this trie. We can simulate this traversal without actually building the trie. We start at `curr = 1`. In a loop, we need to decide whether to go 'deeper' into the trie (e.g., from `1` to `10`) or move to the next sibling (e.g., from `1` to `2`). To make this decision, we calculate how many numbers exist between `curr` and `curr+1` in the lexicographical order (the size of the sub-trie rooted at `curr`). Let's call this `steps`. We have a helper function `calSteps(n1, n2)` to compute this. If `k` is greater than or equal to `steps`, it means the k-th number is not in the `curr` sub-trie, so we can skip the entire sub-trie. We do this by `k -= steps` and `curr += 1`. If `k` is smaller than `steps`, the k-th number is *within* the `curr` sub-trie.

The key to optimizing this is to split the problem in half. The equation can be rewritten as `A[i] + B[j] = -(C[k] + D[l])`. This suggests a two-stage approach using a **hash map**. 1. **First Stage**: Iterate through all pairs of elements from arrays `A` and `B`. For each pair `(a, b)`, calculate their sum `s = a + b`. Store the frequency of these sums in a hash map: `map[s]++`. This takes `O(N^2)` time. 2. **Second Stage**: Now, iterate through all pairs of elements from arrays `C` and `D`. For each pair `(c, d)`, calculate their sum `s' = c + d`. We are looking for cases where `s = -s'`. So, we check our hash map for the key `-s'`.

With `minutesToTest` and `minutesToDie`, a single pig can test `T = floor(minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1` states. The `+1` state is the pig not dying, which means the poison is in a bucket it didn't drink from. So, each pig acts like a digit in a base-`T` number system. With `p` pigs, we can distinguish between `T^p` different outcomes. We need to have enough outcomes to identify every single bucket. Therefore, we need to find the smallest number of pigs `p` such that `T^p >= B`. Taking the logarithm of both sides gives `p * log(T) >= log(B)`, which simplifies to `p >= log(B) / log(T)`.

The key is to notice that the state of our matching process will eventually repeat. The state can be defined by the current index in `s2` (`s2_idx`) that we are trying to match. Since there are only `len(s2)` possible indices, the state must repeat. We can use a **hash map** to detect this cycle. The map will store `{s2_idx -> (s1_round_count, s2_round_count)}`. We simulate the process round by round, iterating through `s1`. After each full iteration of `s1`, we check if the current `s2_idx` is already in our map. If it is, we have found a cycle. We can then calculate: 1. How many `s1`s and `s2`s were in the cycle. 2. How many times this cycle will repeat in the remaining `n1` rounds. 3. Calculate the number of `s2`s in the non-cyclical prefix and the remaining suffix. Summing these parts gives the answer without simulating all `n1` rounds.",

The naive approach of `(rand7() + rand7()) % 10 + 1` is incorrect because the sums are not uniformly distributed (7 is more likely than 2 or 12). The standard technique for this is **Rejection Sampling**. The idea is to generate a number in a larger uniform range and then only accept numbers that fall within a sub-range that is a multiple of our target range (10). 1. We can generate a uniform random number from 1 to 49 by using `rand7()` twice: `num = (rand7() - 1) * 7 + rand7()`. This maps the 7x7 grid of outcomes to a linear 1-49 range. 2. Now we have numbers 1-49. We want a range that is a multiple of 10. The range 1-40 works. 3. We check if our generated `num` is in the range `[1, 40]`. If it is, we can proceed. If `num > 40` (i.e., 41-49), we *reject* this sample and re-roll by going back to step 1. 4.

This means we must be able to partition the set into 4 subsets, each with an equal sum. 1. **Feasibility Check**: First, calculate the total sum of all matchstick lengths. If this sum is not divisible by 4, it's impossible to form a square, so we return `False`. The target length for each side of the square will be `side_length = total_sum / 4`. Also, if any single matchstick is longer than `side_length`, it's impossible. 2. **Backtracking**: This is a classic partition problem, best solved with backtracking (DFS). We can define a recursive function `dfs(matchstick_index, side_sums)`. `side_sums` can be a list of 4 numbers representing the current lengths of the four sides we are building. The function tries to place the matchstick at `matchstick_index` into each of the four sides. For each side `i`, if adding the current matchstick does not exceed `side_length`, we add it (`side_sums[i] += matchstick`) and recursively call `dfs(matchstick_index + 1)`. If the recursive call returns `True`, we've found a solution. If not, we **backtrack** by removing the matchstick (`side_sums[i] -= matchstick`) and try placing it on the next side. **Optimization**: Sorting the matchsticks in descending order can significantly speed up the process by pruning the search space earlier.",

A much more efficient `O(N)` approach is to consider the problem **bit by bit**. We can iterate through each bit position, from 0 to 31. For each bit position `i`, we count how many numbers in the array have a `1` at that position (`ones_count`) and how many have a `0` (`zeros_count`, which is `N - ones_count`).

A naive approach might be to pick a random radius `r` in `[0, R]` and a random angle `theta` in `[0, 2*pi]`, then calculate the point `(r*cos(theta), r*sin(theta))`. This is **incorrect** because it leads to a higher density of points near the center. The area of a ring increases with `r`, so we need to pick points with a higher probability as `r` increases. \n1. **Rejection Sampling**: A simple and correct method. Generate a random point within the bounding square of the circle. The square is from `[x-R, x+R]` and `[y-R, y+R]`. Pick a random `x_rand` and `y_rand` in these ranges. Then, check if this point `(x_rand, y_rand)` is inside the circle (i.e., `(x_rand-x_c)^2 + (y_rand-y_c)^2 <= R^2`). If it is, return it. If not, reject it and repeat the process. \n2. **Inverse Transform Sampling (Polar Coordinates)**: A more direct `O(1)` method. To correct the bias towards the center, we need to pick the radius such that the probability is proportional to the area. This means the probability of picking a radius `r` should be proportional to `r`. We can achieve this by picking a random number `u` from `[0,1]` and setting our radius to `R * sqrt(u)`. The angle can be picked uniformly from `[0, 2*pi]`. Then, `x = x_c + (R*sqrt(u))*cos(theta)` and `y = y_c + (R*sqrt(u))*sin(theta)` gives a uniformly random point.",

The total poisoned time is the total length of the union of these intervals. A simple greedy approach works: 1. Initialize `total_duration = 0`. 2. Iterate through the `timeSeries` from the second element. For each attack at `timeSeries[i]`, compare it with the previous attack at `timeSeries[i-1]`. 3. The duration of the poison from the previous attack is either the full `duration` or the time until the next attack, whichever is smaller. So, the time added by the `(i-1)`-th attack is `min(duration, timeSeries[i] - timeSeries[i-1])`. 4. Add this amount to `total_duration`. 5.

The correct approach is weighted random sampling, where the weight is the area. 1. **Pre-computation (`__init__`)**: a. For each rectangle, calculate its area (number of integer points). Be careful with inclusive boundaries: area = `(x2-x1+1)*(y2-y1+1)`. b.

Generate a random integer `rand_val` from 1 to the total area (the last element of our prefix sum array). b. Use **binary search** (`bisect_left`) on the prefix sum array to find which rectangle this `rand_val` 'lands' in. This correctly selects a rectangle with a probability proportional to its area. c.

This combination of 'shortest' and a tie-breaking rule points directly to Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nWe use a priority queue (min-heap) to always explore the most promising path first. The state stored in our queue is a tuple: `(distance, path_string, x, y)`. The priority queue automatically sorts by the first element (distance), and if distances are equal, it sorts by the second (path_string), handling both our requirements perfectly.\n\nWe also maintain a `stopped` dictionary to keep track of the shortest distance and path found so far for each cell `(x, y)`. This prevents cycles and redundant computations. When we land on a cell, we only push a new path to the queue if it's better (shorter distance, or same distance with a lexicographically smaller path) than what's recorded in `stopped`.",

For this problem, we'll use a decreasing monotonic stack, where we store indices of elements in decreasing value order.\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n1. Initialize a result array with -1s and an empty stack.\n2. To handle the circular nature, we iterate through the array twice. A simple way is to iterate from `i = 0 to 2*n - 1` and use the modulo operator `i % n` to get the actual index.\n3. In each iteration, we look at the current number `nums[i % n]`. While the stack is not empty and the number at the top of the stack is smaller than the current number, we've found the 'next greater element'. We pop the index from the stack and update our result array at that index with the current number.\n4. After the while loop, we push the current index `i % n` onto the stack.\n\nBy the end of the two passes, any indices remaining on the stack correspond to elements that have no greater element in the circular array, so their result value remains -1.",

However, this is **extremely inefficient**. For example, to compute `fib(5)`, it computes `fib(4)` and `fib(3)`. To compute `fib(4)`, it re-computes `fib(3)` and `fib(2)`. The same subproblems are solved over and over again, leading to an exponential time complexity of O(2^N).\n\nThis is a classic problem to demonstrate **Dynamic Programming**.\n\n1.  **Memoization (Top-Down DP):** We can use the recursive structure but store the result of each `fib(i)` in a cache (like a hash map or array). Before computing `fib(i)`, we check if it's already in the cache. If so, we return the cached value. This brings the time complexity down to O(N) at the cost of O(N) space for the cache.\n\n2.  **Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP):** A better approach is to build the solution iteratively. We know F(0) and F(1). We can calculate F(2) from them. Then F(3) from F(2) and F(1), and so on, up to N. This takes O(N) time and uses an array of size N.\n\n3.  **Space-Optimized DP:** We can notice that to calculate F(i), we only need the previous two values, F(i-1) and F(i-2). We don't need the entire array. We can solve the problem iteratively using just two variables to store the last two numbers, bringing the space complexity down to O(1). This is the optimal solution.",

This is our base case: there is exactly one way to make change for amount 0 (by using no coins).\n\nThe key insight is the order of iteration. To count combinations (where `[1, 2]` is the same as `[2, 1]`), we must iterate through the **coins first** in the outer loop, and then the amounts in the inner loop.\n\nFor each coin, we update the `dp` array. For an amount `i`, the number of ways to make change for it can be increased by using the current `coin`. The number of new combinations we can form is equal to the number of ways we could form the amount `i - coin`, because we can simply add the current `coin` to each of those combinations.\n\nSo, the transition is: `dp[i] += dp[i - coin]`.",

If it is, repeat until an unused cell is found. This works well when the matrix is sparse, but as more cells are flipped, the probability of collisions increases, and the `flip` operation can become very slow, potentially looping forever.\n\nThe **optimal solution** avoids this by effectively shrinking the search space. Imagine the `R*C` matrix cells are flattened into a virtual 1D array of size `N = R*C`. We want to randomly pick an index from `0` to `N-1`, but only from the available cells.\n\nThe trick is to use a hash map to handle swaps:\n1.  Maintain a `total` count of available cells, initially `R*C`.\n2.  In `flip()`, generate a random index `r` from `0` to `total-1`.\n3.  We need to map this virtual index `r` to an actual `(row, col)`. We use a hash map `self.map` to store any remappings. The actual index we'll use is `self.map.get(r, r)`.\n4.  To ensure we don't pick this index `r` again, we 'swap' it with the last available index, `total-1`. We store this swap in our map: `self.map[r] = self.map.get(total-1, total-1)`.\n5.

We can use a hash map to group words based on the key `(len(word), word[0], word[-1])`.\n\nAfter grouping, we process each group independently. For each word in a group, we need to find the shortest prefix that makes its abbreviation unique within that group. We can calculate the longest common prefix (LCP) between a word and all other words in its group. The required prefix length for its unique abbreviation will be `LCP + 1`.

But the number is len-prefix-1, which must be >= 2 for an abbreviation to happen. This implies the length of the abbreviation must be shorter than the word. `p + 1 + len(str(num))` < `len(word)`. `li1e` has length 4. Same as word.

We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization to solve this.  The DFS explores all possible paths the knight can take. Memoization stores the probability of staying on the board from a given position after a certain number of moves, to avoid redundant computations.  The base case is when the knight is off the board or has made K moves; otherwise, we recursively explore all 8 possible moves from the current position, calculate the probability of staying on the board for each move, and sum them up, averaging them at each step.

Then, iterate through all emails. If an email hasn't been visited yet, start a traversal (DFS or BFS) from it to find all emails in its component. Keep a `visited` set to avoid redundant traversals. Store the results, sort the emails, and add the owner's name.\n\n2.  **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)**: This is often more efficient and elegant for connectivity problems. Treat each email as an element in a set. We iterate through each account and for every pair of emails in that account, we perform a `union` operation. This merges the sets containing these emails. After processing all accounts, we can iterate through all the emails again. For each email, we use the `find` operation to determine the root parent of its set.

This suggests a dynamic programming approach on substrings.\n\nLet `dp(i, j)` be the number of unique palindromic subsequences in the substring `S[i...j]`.\n\nTo compute `dp(i, j)`, we can consider characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' as potential boundaries of our palindromes.\nFor a character, say `char = 'a'`, we find its first occurrence `l` and last occurrence `r` within `S[i...j]`.\n- If `char` does not exist in `S[i...j]`, it contributes 0 to the count.\n- If `char` appears only once (`l == r`), it forms one palindrome: `'a'`. This adds 1 to our total.\n- If `char` appears multiple times (`l < r`), it can form palindromes `'a'` and `'aa'`. The inner part `S[l+1...r-1]` can form other palindromes. So, the palindromes starting and ending with `'a'` would be `'a'` (the single one), `'aa'`, and `'a' + (palindrome from `S[l+1...r-1]`) + `'a'`. The number of these is `2 + dp(l+1, r-1)`.\n\nWe sum this up for all four characters.\n\n**DP Recurrence:**\n`dp(i, j) = sum(count for char in 'a'...'d')`\nwhere for each `char`:\n  `l = find_first(char, i, j)`\n  `r = find_last(char, i, j)`\n  - if `l == -1`: count = 0\n  - if `l == r`: count = 1\n  - if `l < r`: count = 2 + dp(l+1, r-1)\n\nThis can be implemented with recursion and memoization to store the results of `dp(i, j)`.",

For `(add 1 (mult 2 3))`, the components are `add`, `1`, and `(mult 2 3)`.\n    - Check the operation type (`let`, `add`, or `mult`).\n    - **`let` expression**: `(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... en)`.\n      - Create a new scope that inherits from the parent scope.\n      - Iterate through the variable/expression pairs (`v1 e1`, `v2 e2`, ...). For each pair, evaluate the expression `ei` using the *current* new scope, and then assign the result to the variable `vi` in that same scope.\n      - The final component `en` is the expression to be returned. Evaluate it in the final version of the new scope and return the result.\n    - **`add` expression**: `(add e1 e2)`.\n      - Recursively call `evaluate` on `e1` and `e2` with the current scope.\n      - Return the sum of the results.\n    - **`mult` expression**: `(mult e1 e2)`.\n      - Recursively call `evaluate` on `e1` and `e2` with the current scope.\n      - Return the product of the results.",
    "dry_run": "Example: `(let x 2 (mult x 5))`\n`evaluate('(let x 2 (mult x 5))', {})`\n1. It's a `let` expression. Create a new scope `scope1 = {}`.\n2. First pair is `x` and `2`. `evaluate('2', scope1)` returns `2`. Assign `scope1['x'] = 2`.\n3. Final expression is `(mult x 5)`. Evaluate this in `scope1`.\n   - `evaluate('(mult x 5)', {'x': 2})`:\n     - It's a `mult` expression.\n     - Evaluate `x` in `{'x': 2}` -> returns `2`.\n     - Evaluate `5` in `{'x': 2}` -> returns `5`.\n     - Return `2 * 5 = 10`.\n4.

This is a greedy problem.\n\nLet's work with the number as a string of digits. We want to keep the number as large as possible, which means we should try to change the digits as little as possible, and from right to left (the least significant digits first).\n\n**Greedy Algorithm**:\n1.  Convert the number `N` to a list of its digits.\n2.  Iterate through the digits from right to left, starting from the second-to-last digit.\n3.  At each position `i`, compare the digit `digits[i]` with the one to its right, `digits[i+1]`.\n4.  If we find a position `i` where `digits[i] > digits[i+1]`, we have found a violation of the monotone property. To fix this, we must:\n    - Decrement `digits[i]` by 1.\n    - To maximize the resulting number, change all digits to the right of `i` to `9`.\n5.  We need to store the position of the leftmost digit we change to a `9`. Let's call it `cliff`. When we decrement `digits[i]`, we mark `i+1` as the new `cliff`.\n6.  After the initial pass, we have a potentially valid number, but decrementing a digit might have caused a new violation to its left (e.g., in `332`, changing to `329` is wrong; it should be `299`). \n\n**A better, simpler greedy strategy**:\n1.  Convert N to a list of digits `S`.\n2.  Iterate from right-to-left, from `n-2` down to `0`.\n3.  If `S[i] > S[i+1]`, we have a violation. This means `S[i]` must be decreased. To make the number as large as possible, we decrement `S[i]` by 1 and set all following digits to `9`.\n4.  To ensure the resulting number is still valid, we need to find the point where the number 'breaks'. We can find the first violation from left-to-right. Let's say `S[i-1] > S[i]`. This is the 'cliff'. We need to decrement `S[i-1]` and change all subsequent digits to `9`. But what if `S[i-2] == S[i-1]`? like in 332 -> 299. The cliff is actually at index 0.

    "whiteboard": "The problem asks us to find, for each day, how many days we have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there's no future warmer day, the answer is 0.\n\nA naive approach would be to use nested loops: for each day `i`, search through all future days `j > i`. This is O(N^2) and too slow.\n\nA much more efficient solution uses a **Monotonic Stack**. The stack will store the *indices* of the days, and we will maintain the property that the temperatures corresponding to the indices on the stack are strictly decreasing from bottom to top.\n\n**Algorithm**:\n1.  Initialize an empty stack and a result array of zeros with the same length as the input temperatures.\n2.  Iterate through the `temperatures` array with both index `i` and value `temp`.\n3.  For each `(i, temp)`:\n    - Look at the index at the top of the stack, say `prev_day_index`.\n    - **While** the stack is not empty AND the current `temp` is warmer than the temperature on the day at the top of the stack (`temp > temperatures[stack[-1]]`):\n      - This means we've found the next warmer day for the day at `stack[-1]`.\n      - Pop the index from the stack: `prev_day_index = stack.pop()`.\n      - Calculate the wait days: `result[prev_day_index] = i - prev_day_index`.\n      - Continue the `while` loop, as the current day might also be warmer than the next day on the stack.\n4.  After the `while` loop, push the current day's index `i` onto the stack. This maintains the monotonic decreasing property.\n\nAfter iterating through all temperatures, any indices left on the stack are for days that never found a warmer day. Our result array was initialized to zeros, so these are already correctly handled.",

We don't care about the individual numbers, but rather the sum of points we get for choosing a number. We can create a 'points' array (or hash map) where `points[x]` is the total points earned by picking the number `x`. For example, if `nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`, then `points[2]=4`, `points[3]=9`, `points[4]=4`.\n\nNow, the problem is: we can pick a number `x` and get `points[x]`, but if we do, we cannot pick `x-1` or `x+1`. This is exactly the House Robber problem on our `points` array. We can't 'rob' adjacent houses.\n\n**Dynamic Programming Approach**:\nLet `dp[i]` be the maximum points we can earn by considering numbers up to `i`.\nTo calculate `dp[i]`, we have two choices:\n1.  **Don't take `i`**: If we don't take the number `i`, we get no points from `i`. Our total points would be the maximum we could get from numbers up to `i-1`. So, `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`.\n2.  **Take `i`**: If we take the number `i`, we get `points[i]`. Since we can't take `i-1`, the previous points must have come from the maximum we could get from numbers up to `i-2`. So, `dp[i] = points[i] + dp[i-2]`.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: \n`dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], points[i] + dp[i-2])`\n\nWe can optimize the space from O(M) to O(1) by only keeping track of the last two DP values, let's call them `prev1` (for `dp[i-1]`) and `prev2` (for `dp[i-2]`).",

This is a classic **single-source shortest path** problem in a weighted, directed graph.\n\nSince all edge weights (travel times) are positive, **Dijkstra's algorithm** is the perfect tool for the job. It finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1.  **Build Graph**: First, represent the network as a graph. An adjacency list is efficient, where `adj[u] = [(v, w), ...]` stores a list of tuples for outgoing edges from node `u` to `v` with weight `w`.\n\n2.  **Initialize**: \n    - We need a min-priority queue (min-heap) to always process the node that can be reached in the shortest time so far. Push the starting node `K` with time 0 onto the heap: `(0, K)`.\n    - We need a `distances` dictionary or array to store the shortest time found so far to reach each node. Initialize all to infinity except the start node.\n\n3.  **Main Loop (Dijkstra's)**: \n    - While the priority queue is not empty, pop the element with the smallest time: `(time, node)`.\n    - If we have already found a shorter path to `node`, continue (this handles cycles and redundant paths).\n    - For each neighbor `(neighbor, weight)` of the current `node`:\n      - Calculate the new time to reach this neighbor: `new_time = time + weight`.\n      - If `new_time` is less than the currently known shortest time to `neighbor`, it means we've found a better path.\n      - Update the shortest time for `neighbor` and push `(new_time, neighbor)` onto the priority queue.\n\n4.  **Result**: After the loop terminates, the `distances` dictionary contains the shortest time for the signal to reach each node.

We should prioritize a fast query (`f`) method, which implies doing more work during initialization.\n\n- **Naive Approach**: Store words in a list. For each query, iterate through all words, checking `startswith(prefix)` and `endswith(suffix)`. This is `O(N*L)` per query, which is too slow.\n\n- **Pre-computation with HashMaps**: The user's solution. Create two hashmaps: `prefix_map` -> `{prefix: {set of words}}` and `suffix_map` -> `{suffix: {set of words}}`. In the constructor, for each word, generate all its prefixes and suffixes and populate the maps. For a query, find the intersection of the word sets from `prefix_map[prefix]` and `suffix_map[suffix]`. Then find the max index among those words. This is better, but intersection can be slow.\n\n- **Trie-based Approach (Optimal for discussion)**: A Trie is the standard data structure for prefix searches. How can we handle suffixes? We can build a single, clever Trie. For each word `w` (e.g., \"apple\") with index `i`, we generate all its suffixes (\"apple\", \"pple\", \"ple\", \"le\", \"e\"). For each suffix, we create a new string like `suffix + '#' + w` (e.g., `\"pple#apple\"`, `\"ple#apple\"`). We insert all these generated strings into a single Trie. At each node in the Trie, we also store the maximum index `i` of the word that created that path.\n\n- **Querying the Trie**: To search for `f(prefix, suffix)`, we search the Trie for the string `suffix + '#' + prefix`.

We can do this by iterating through the `plate_map`. For each `(letter, count)` in `plate_map`, check if `word_map[letter] >= count`. If this holds true for all letters in the plate, the word is completing.\n      - If the word is completing, update `result = word`.\n\n3.  After checking all words, `result` will hold the shortest completing word that appeared earliest in the list. Return `result`.",
    "dry_run": "Example: `lp = '1s3 PSt'`, `words = ['step', 'steps', 'stripe']`\n1. **Plate Map**: Process '1s3 PSt'. Letters are s, P, S, t. Lowercase: s, p, s, t.\n   - `plate_map = {'s': 2, 'p': 1, 't': 1}`.\n2. **Iterate Words**: `result = None`.\n   - **word = 'step'**: `len=4`. `word_map = {'s':1, 't':1, 'e':1, 'p':1}`.\n     - Check 's': `plate_map['s']=2`, `word_map['s']=1`. `1 < 2`.

We can just work with `abs(target)`.\n2.  **Sum of Steps**: We will take `k` steps, moving either `+i` or `-i` at each step `i`. The final position is `sum( +/- i )` for `i=1..k`. Let's first assume we always go right. The maximum position we can reach in `k` steps is `S = 1 + 2 + ... + k`.\n3.  **Flipping a Sign**: If we change a move from `+i` to `-i`, the total sum `S` changes by `-2*i`. This means any reachable number from `S` must have the same parity as `S`. The difference between our sum `S` and the `target` must be an even number, because this difference must be equal to the sum of some `2*i` terms.\n\n**Algorithm**:\n1.  Take the absolute value of `target`.\n2.  Find the smallest number of steps `k` such that the sum `S = 1 + 2 + ... + k` is greater than or equal to `target`.\n3.  At this point, `S >= target`.\n4.  Calculate the difference: `delta = S - target`.\n5.  If `delta` is even, it means we can flip the signs of some combination of steps `i` such that the sum of `2*i` equals `delta`. We have found our answer, and it is `k`.\n6.  If `delta` is odd, we cannot reach the target in `k` steps. We need to take more steps.\n    - Take one more step, `k+1`. The new sum is `S + k+1`. The new `delta` is `S - target + k+1`.\n      - If `k+1` is odd, the new `delta` will become even. So the answer is `k+1`.\n    - Take another step, `k+2`. The new sum is `S + k+1 + k+2`.

Sort the `intervals` by their end points.\n2.  Initialize our solution set `S`.

To be as greedy as possible for future intervals, we should pick the two largest numbers possible from this interval, which are `end` and `end-1`.\n      - We add two numbers to our set.

Return `True`.\n      - If `colors[neighbor] == 0` (White) and a recursive call `dfs(neighbor)` returns `True`, it means that neighbor found a cycle. Propagate this by returning `True`.\n    - If the loop finishes without finding a cycle, it means this node is safe. Set `colors[node] = 2` (Black) and return `False`.\n\n3.  Iterate through all nodes from `0` to `N-1`. If a node is unvisited (`color == 0`), call `dfs` on it.\n\n4.  After the main loop, all nodes with `color == 2` (Black) are safe nodes.

    "whiteboard": "This is a game theory problem that simplifies to a mathematical insight about XOR properties.\n\nLet the XOR sum of all numbers on the board be `X`.\n\n**Winning and Losing States**:\n- A player **loses** if it's their turn and they cannot make a move. This happens when the XOR sum of the numbers on the board is 0. If `X=0`, they cannot remove a number `n` because the new XOR sum would be `X ^ n = 0 ^ n = n`, which is not 0. Thus, they are forced to make the XOR sum non-zero, and they lose.\n- A player **wins** if they can force the other player into a losing state.\n\n**Alice's First Move**:\n1.  **Case 1: The initial XOR sum is 0.**\n    - `xor(nums) == 0`.\n    - Alice cannot make a move that keeps the sum at 0. Any number `n` she removes will change the sum to `n`. She loses immediately. Oh, wait, the rule is the player who erases a number wins if the XOR sum becomes 0. So if `xor(nums) == 0` initially, Alice can remove any number `n`, the sum becomes `n`. The next player, Bob, has to play. Let's re-read the problem carefully: \"If a player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the numbers currently on the chalkboard equal to 0, that player wins.\"\n    - Okay, so if `xor(nums) == 0` at the start of her turn, Alice wins immediately. \n\n2.  **Case 2: The initial XOR sum is not 0.**\n    - Alice must make a move. She needs to remove a number `n` such that the remaining XOR sum `X ^ n` is something Bob cannot win from.\n    - Can Alice always make a move? She can remove any number `n`. After her move, the new sum is `X' = X ^ n`.\n    - Now it's Bob's turn. If Bob can't win, Alice might win. \n    - Let's consider the number of elements, `N`.\n    - If `N` is **even**: Can Alice always choose a number `n` to remove such that the remaining XOR sum `X ^ n` is not 0? Yes. If `X ^ n = 0`, it would mean `n = X`. But if Alice removes `n=X`, the remaining `N-1` (odd number of) elements have an XOR sum of 0. Now it's Bob's turn with an odd number of elements and a sum of 0. He can't win immediately. He removes a number `m`. The sum becomes `m`. Now it's Alice's turn... this gets complicated.\n\n**The Simple Insight**:\n- If the starting `xor == 0`, Alice wins. 🎉\n- If the starting `xor != 0`:\n  - If `len(nums)` is **even**, Alice can always make a move. Why? The sum of `X ^ n` over all `n` in `nums` is `(X^n1) ^ (X^n2) ...`. This simplifies based on whether N is even or odd. The point is, there will always be at least one `n` she can remove such that the remaining XOR sum is not 0. Since she can always make a move, and each move removes one number, the game must end. The game ends when someone faces a board of length 1 with a non-zero number. Since Alice starts with an even number of elements, she will always play on turns with an even number of elements remaining (N, N-2, N-4...). Bob will play on turns with an odd number of elements (N-1, N-3...). The game must end on Bob's turn, so Alice wins.\n  - If `len(nums)` is **odd**, Alice might be forced to create a state where the XOR sum is 0 for Bob. In this case, Bob would win. So Alice loses.\n\n**Conclusion**: Alice wins if `xor(nums) == 0` OR `len(nums) % 2 == 0`.",

The goal is to maximize the sum of the averages of these subarrays.\n\nThis problem has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, making it a good candidate for **dynamic programming**.\n\n**DP State**: Let `dp[k][i]` be the largest sum of averages we can get by partitioning the subarray `A[0...i-1]` (the first `i` elements) into exactly `k` groups.\n\n**DP Recurrence**:\nTo calculate `dp[k][i]`, we need to decide where the last partition (the `k`-th group) ends. Let's say the `k-1`-th partition ends at index `j-1`, and the `k`-th partition is the subarray `A[j...i-1]`.\n- The first `k-1` partitions are formed from the subarray `A[0...j-1]`, and their maximum score is `dp[k-1][j]`.\n- The score of the last partition is the average of `A[j...i-1]`.\n\nWe need to try all possible split points `j` (from `k-1` to `i-1`):\n`dp[k][i] = max(dp[k-1][j] + average(A[j...i-1]))` for `j` in `range(k-1, i)`.\n\n**Base Case**:\n- For `k=1`, `dp[1][i]` is simply the average of the entire subarray `A[0...i-1]`.\n\n**Final Answer**: The problem allows for *at most* `K` partitions. This means the answer could be the result of using 1, 2, ..., up to K partitions. So, the final answer is `max(dp[k][N])` for `k` in `range(1, K+1)`. However, the score will always increase or stay the same with more partitions, so the answer is just `dp[K][N]`.\n\n**Optimization**: We can pre-compute prefix sums of `A` to calculate `average(A[j...i-1])` in O(1) time.",

For `'123'`, the splits are `('1', '23')` and `('12', '3')`.\n\n2.  **Generate Valid Numbers**: For each part (e.g., `'1'`, `'23'`), we need a helper function that generates all possible valid numeric representations. A number is valid if:\n    - It's an integer: Must not have a leading zero unless it's just `'0'`.\n    - It's a decimal: Must not have a leading zero in the integer part (unless it's just `'0'`). Must not have trailing zeros in the decimal part.\n\n**Algorithm**:\n1.  Take the input string `S` and extract the numeric part `s = S[1:-1]`.\n2.  Create a result list.\n3.  Loop `i` from 1 to `len(s)-1`. This `i` is the split point.\n    - `part1 = s[:i]`\n    - `part2 = s[i:]`\n4.  Call a helper function `generate_numbers(part)` for both `part1` and `part2`. This function returns a list of all valid string representations.\n    - `list1 = generate_numbers(part1)`\n    - `list2 = generate_numbers(part2)`\n5.  If both lists are non-empty, create all combinations: for each `x` in `list1` and `y` in `list2`, add the formatted string `\"({}, {})\"`.format(x, y)` to the result.\n\n**`generate_numbers(string s)` Helper**:\n- Initialize `valid_nums = []`.\n- **Integer part**: If `s` is a valid integer (no leading zero unless it's just '0'), add `s` to `valid_nums`.\n- **Decimal part**: Loop `j` from 1 to `len(s)-1` to place the decimal point.\n  - `integer_part = s[:j]`\n  - `decimal_part = s[j:]`\n  - If `integer_part` is a valid integer AND `decimal_part` has no trailing zeros, then `integer_part + '.' + decimal_part` is a valid number.

The rule is that if a word is a suffix of another word, it doesn't need its own separate entry in `S`.\n\nExample: `words = [\"time\", \"me\", \"bell\"]`\n- `\"me\"` is a suffix of `\"time\"`.\n- So, we only need to encode `\"time\"` and `\"bell\"`.\n- A possible `S` is `\"time#bell#\"`. Its length is `len(\"time\") + 1 + len(\"bell\") + 1 = 5 + 5 = 10`.\n\n**Key Insight**: The reference string will be formed by the words that are not suffixes of any other word in the list.\n\n**Algorithm (Using a Set)**:\n1.  Create a hash set containing all the words from the input list. This gives us a collection of unique words.\n2.  Iterate through each `word` in the original `words` list.\n3.  For each `word`, generate all of its proper suffixes (i.e., from index 1 onwards). For `\"time\"`, the suffixes are `\"ime\"`, `\"me\"`, `\"e\"`.\n4.  For each `suffix` generated, try to remove it from our hash set. The `discard` method is useful here as it doesn't raise an error if the suffix is not in the set.\n5.  After iterating through all the words, the set will only contain the words that are not suffixes of any other word.\n6.  The final length is the sum of the lengths of the remaining words in the set, plus 1 (for the `#` delimiter) for each word.\n\n**Alternative (Trie)**: A more canonical solution involves a Trie. Insert the *reverse* of each word into a Trie. The length of the encoding is the sum of the depths of all the leaf nodes in the Trie, plus the number of leaf nodes.",

We can flip any row or any column.\n\nThis is a **greedy problem**. To maximize the total sum, we should try to make the most significant bits '1's as often as possible.\n\n**Greedy Strategy**:\n1.  **Maximize the Most Significant Bit (MSB)**: The leftmost column (column 0) represents the most significant bit for each row's number. To maximize the total score, this bit should be a '1' for every single row. So, our first step is to iterate through each row. If a row starts with a '0', we **flip the entire row**. After this step, the entire first column will consist of '1's, guaranteeing the largest possible contribution from this bit position.\n\n2.  **Maximize Subsequent Columns**: Now, consider the remaining columns from left to right (from most to least significant). For each column `j`, we want to have as many '1's as possible. We can either keep the column as it is or flip it. We should choose the option that results in more '1's. \n    - Count the number of '1's in the current column. Let's say it's `ones_count`.\n    - The number of '0's is `m - ones_count`, where `m` is the number of rows.\n    - If we flip the column, the new number of '1's will be `m - ones_count`.\n    - We should choose the configuration with more '1's. So, the number of '1's we can have in this column is `max(ones_count, m - ones_count)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Score**: After applying these greedy choices, we can calculate the final score. The score contribution of each column `j` is `(number_of_ones_in_col_j) * 2^(n-1-j)`. Summing this up for all columns gives the final answer.",

Contribution: `3 * 2^3 = 24`.\n    - Column 1: Two '1's, one '0'. `max(2, 1) = 2`. Keep it. Contribution: `2 * 2^2 = 8`.\n    - Column 2: One '1', two '0's. `max(1, 2) = 2`. Flip the column.

The presence of negative numbers means a standard two-pointer sliding window will not work, as shrinking the window from the left does not guarantee the sum will decrease.\n\n**Approach: Prefix Sums and a Monotonic Deque**\n1.  **Prefix Sums**: First, let's transform the problem. The sum of a subarray `A[i..j]` is `prefix_sum[j+1] - prefix_sum[i]`. We are looking for the smallest `j - i + 1` such that `prefix[j+1] - prefix[i] >= K`.\n    For each `j`, we want to find an `i < j` that satisfies `prefix[i] <= prefix[j+1] - K` and minimizes `j - i + 1`.\n\n2.  **Monotonic Deque**: We can process the prefix sums from left to right. We need an efficient way to find the best `i` for each `j`. We can use a **monotonic deque** (double-ended queue) that stores *indices* of the prefix sum array.\n    The deque will maintain indices `i` such that their corresponding `prefix_sum[i]` values are strictly increasing.\n\n**Algorithm**:\n1.  Compute the prefix sums of `A` and store them in an array `P` of size N+1.\n2.  Initialize an empty deque and `min_len = infinity`.\n3.  Iterate `j` from `0` to `N` (iterating through `P`):\n    a. **Check Condition**: Look at the front of the deque, `i = deque[0]`. While the deque is not empty and `P[j] - P[i] >= K`, we have found a valid subarray. Update `min_len = min(min_len, j - i)` and pop `i` from the *front* of the deque (since we want the shortest subarray, we're done with this `i`).\n    b. **Maintain Monotonicity**: Look at the back of the deque, `k = deque[-1]`. While the deque is not empty and `P[j] <= P[k]`, pop `k` from the *back* of the deque. This is because if we have `i1 < i2` and `P[i1] >= P[i2]`, `i1` is a worse candidate than `i2` for any future `j`, as it gives a larger sum for a smaller length benefit.\n    c. **Add Current Index**: Append the current index `j` to the back of the deque.\n4.

The challenge is defining the state.\n\nA simple `(row, col)` state is not enough, because our ability to move (i.e., open locks) depends on the keys we've collected.\n\n**State Representation**:\nThe state must include our location and the keys we possess. A perfect way to represent this is `(row, col, keys_mask)`.\n- `(row, col)`: Current position in the grid.\n- `keys_mask`: A bitmask representing the set of keys collected. If the j-th bit is 1, it means we have the j-th key (e.g., 'a' is key 0, 'b' is key 1, etc.).\n\n**Algorithm (BFS)**:\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    - Find the starting position `(start_r, start_c)` and the total number of keys, `K`.\n    - Create the `target_mask = (1 << K) - 1`.\n    - Initialize a queue with the starting state: `queue.append((start_r, start_c, 0, 0))` -> `(row, col, mask, steps)`.\n    - Initialize a `visited` set to store `(row, col, mask)` tuples we've seen.\n\n2.  **BFS Loop**:\n    - Dequeue `(r, c, mask, steps)`.\n    - If `mask == target_mask`, we have all the keys. Return `steps`.\n    - For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`:\n      - Let `cell = grid[nr][nc]`.\n      - **Empty/Start**: If `cell` is `.` or `@`, and `(nr, nc, mask)` is unvisited, add it to the queue and visited set.\n      - **Key**: If `cell` is a key (`'a'-'f'`), calculate the `new_mask` by setting the corresponding bit. If `(nr, nc, new_mask)` is unvisited, add it to the queue and visited set.\n      - **Lock**: If `cell` is a lock (`'A'-'F'`), check if we have the key by checking the corresponding bit in our current `mask`. If we have the key and `(nr, nc, mask)` is unvisited, add it to the queue and visited set.\n      - **Wall**: If `cell` is `#`, do nothing.\n\n3.

For example, the first half '123' can generate the palindromes '12321' and '123321'.\n    - Start with a number `x` (e.g., `x=1`).\n    - Create an odd-length palindrome from it (e.g., `1` -> `1`, `12` -> `121`).\n    - Create an even-length palindrome from it (e.g., `1` -> `11`, `12` -> `1221`).\n\n2.  **Primality Test**: For each palindrome `p` we generate, we need an efficient primality test.\n    - A number `p` is prime if it's not divisible by any number from 2 up to `sqrt(p)`.\n    - We can optimize by checking divisibility by 2 separately, and then only checking odd divisors up to `sqrt(p)`.\n\n3.  **Main Loop**: \n    - Start generating palindromes in increasing order.\n    - For each generated palindrome `p`:\n      - If `p >= N` AND `is_prime(p)`, then `p` is our answer. Return it.\n\n**Important Insight**: All even-length palindromes (except 11) are divisible by 11. `1221 = 11 * 111`. We can prove this with modular arithmetic. This means we only need to generate and test odd-length palindromes for `N > 11`.",

We need to determine if Alex, the first player, can guarantee a win.\n\n**DP Approach (General Solution)**:\n- Let `dp[i][j]` be the maximum score the current player can get *more* than their opponent from the subarray of piles `piles[i...j]`.\n- **Recurrence**: If the current player chooses `piles[i]`, the opponent will play on `piles[i+1...j]`. The opponent's score from that sub-problem is `dp[i+1][j]`. So the current player's score relative to the opponent is `piles[i] - dp[i+1][j]`. Similarly, if they choose `piles[j]`, their score is `piles[j] - dp[i][j-1]`. The player will choose the move that maximizes this difference.\n- `dp[i][j] = max(piles[i] - dp[i+1][j], piles[j] - dp[i][j-1])`.\n- The final answer is `dp[0][n-1] > 0`.\n- This DP is O(N^2).\n\n**Mathematical Insight (Specific to this Problem's Constraints)**:\nHowever, the problem has specific constraints that allow for a much simpler solution:\n1.  There is an **even** number of piles.\n2.  The total sum of stones is **odd** (so there can be no ties).\n\nConsider the piles at odd indices (1, 3, 5...) and even indices (0, 2, 4...). Let `sum_odd` be the sum of stones at odd indices and `sum_even` be the sum of stones at even indices.\n- Since the total sum is odd, `sum_odd != sum_even`.\n- Alex (the first player) can choose a strategy at the beginning: either commit to taking all the odd-indexed piles or all the even-indexed piles.\n- Why? Because there's an even number of piles, the ends are always one odd and one even index. Whenever Alex takes a pile (say, an even one), Lee is presented with two ends which are both odd-indexed. Lee must take an odd-indexed pile. This, in turn, presents Alex with two even-indexed ends again.\n- So, Alex can look at `sum_odd` and `sum_even`. If `sum_even > sum_odd`, he can commit to taking only even-indexed piles for the entire game, and he is guaranteed to get them. If `sum_odd > sum_even`, he can commit to the odd ones.\n- Since one of these sums must be larger, Alex can always choose a strategy that guarantees he gets more stones.\n\n**Conclusion**: Alex always wins. The answer is always `True`.",
